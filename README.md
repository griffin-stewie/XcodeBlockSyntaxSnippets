# XcodeBlockSyntaxSnippets

Xcode snippets for [block syntax](http://fuckingblocksyntax.com/). 

## Installation

Move `xxx.codesnippet` files in `CodeSnippets` to

```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets
```

## Usage

I defined completion shortcuts start `blockas...`.  
Just type `blockas...`, then you can see what you want to do in code completion list.

## Note

* `As a local variable` is defined by default as `inlineBlock` completion shortcut, but I redefined.
* `As a typedef` is defined by default as `typedefBlock` completion shortcut, but I redefined.
* I don't define `As an argument to a method call`, because Xcode's Auto Completion helps us.
